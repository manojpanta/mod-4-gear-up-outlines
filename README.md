# Mod 4 Gear Up Overview

## Purpose

When employers hear about Gear Up, they are immediately intrigued.  <i>Most companies can teach you technical skills, new frameworks, new languages, but they do not have the time to teach you how to be a great team member, how to be inclusive, or how to discuss topics of diversity.</i>

As you go into the job hunt, being able to talk about ways you have lead in the community and talking about issues of diversity and inclusion will set you apart from other candidates. 

<b>The purpose of Gear Up is to have students build perspective and expertise connecting their technical work to the impact on their peers, community, and world. We want students are equipped to help realize our vision of a world powered by technology where the people building it represent the people using it.</b>
